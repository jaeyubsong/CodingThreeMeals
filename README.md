# CodingThreeMeals: No Need Annoying Alarm Service

This application sets an alarm at random timestamp. 

When executing the application, it itself sets alarm at the time between 12:00 PM and 8:00 PM.

We selected 13 kinds of musics; we chose videos in youtube that we think are annoying, and converted them to mp3.

Examples are: 
```
Coconut song - https://youtu.be/w0AOGeqOnFY 
Yee - https://youtu.be/q6EoRBvdVPQ
I'm confusion - https://youtu.be/yYlnW7-vJ1A
Ahri Death Scream All Languages - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA8u1tkgRxU
```

Until the user completes the mission, the music never stops and the user cannot even adjust the volume. 
Mission is to press the back button 50 times.
